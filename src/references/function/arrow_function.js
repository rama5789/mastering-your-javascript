/* ArrowFunction:

Below are some of Features of Arrow Function:

# Handling of "this":
- The handling of this is different in arrow functions compared to regular functions. In short, with arrow functions there are "no binding" of this.

- In regular functions the this keyword "represented the object that called the function", which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

- With arrow functions, the this keyword always "represents the object that defined the arrow function".
