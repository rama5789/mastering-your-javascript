# Typing :
Various kinds of Typing:

## Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed :

### Statically Typed :
* __Statically Typed__ means that *the __type__ is associated with the __variable__ that holds the __value__*, and checked at __Compile Time__, or before the code is actually executed.

### Dynamically Typed :
* __Dynamically Typed__ means that *the __type__ is associated with the __value__*, and checked at __Run Time__, or as the code is executed.

## Strongly Typed vs Weakly Typed :

### Strongly Typed :
* __Strongly Typed__ language means that the variable type *will NOT be implicitly converted to some other type* at __Run Time__.

### Weakly Typed :
* __Weakly Typed__ language has looser typing rules and may produce unpredictable results or *may be implicitly converted to some other type* at __Run Time__.

## Typing Chart (using XY-Axis) :
1. __Static (X) and Strong (Y)__ : TypeScript, Java, C# etc.
2. __Strong (Y) and Dynamic (-X)__ : Python, Ruby etc. 
3. __Dynamic (-X) and Weak (-Y)__ : Javascript, PHP, VB, Perl etc.
4. __Weak (-Y) and Static (X)__ : C, C++ etc.

> Note:
>   * Statically Typed Language is better than Dynamically Typed Language.
>   * Strongly Typed Language is better than Weakly Typed Language.
