# Typing :

Various kinds of Typing:

## Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed :

### Statically Typed :

- **Statically Typed** means that _the **type** is associated with the **variable** that holds the **value**_, and checked at **Compile Time**, or before the code is actually executed.

### Dynamically Typed :

- **Dynamically Typed** means that _the **type** is associated with the **value**_, and checked at **Run Time**, or as the code is executed.

## Strongly Typed vs Weakly Typed :

### Strongly Typed :

- **Strongly Typed** language means that the variable type _will NOT be implicitly converted to some other type_ at **Run Time**.

### Weakly Typed :

- **Weakly Typed** language has looser typing rules and may produce unpredictable results or _may be implicitly converted to some other type_ at **Run Time**.

## Typing Chart (using XY-Axis) :

1. **Static (X) and Strong (Y)** : TypeScript, Java, C# etc.
2. **Strong (Y) and Dynamic (-X)** : Python, Ruby etc.
3. **Dynamic (-X) and Weak (-Y)** : Javascript, PHP, VB, Perl etc.
4. **Weak (-Y) and Static (X)** : C, C++ etc.

> Note:
>
> - Statically Typed Language is better than Dynamically Typed Language.
> - Strongly Typed Language is better than Weakly Typed Language.
